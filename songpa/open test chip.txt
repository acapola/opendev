Strategy to be the top dog in security (for peanuts)

Key goals:
 - Have full understanding of new papers before they even get published
 - Identify outstanding students before they complete their studies
 - Be able to benchmark research implementation/attacks against each other and against our current know how.
 - Boost image as "the place to be" to do crypto
 
Proposal:
Offer researchers/start-ups to implement their experiments on our testchip, using the same technology as we plan for the next products.
-> present this as a way to have a fair comparison between different proposal, on a state of the art technology.
Researchers would have to provide:
 - User level documentation
 - All the source code and details of the implementation
 - Hard-macro for blocks not using standard cells
 - Results of the measurement
 
we would have to provide:
 - User documentation of the basic system
 - Specification for the interface with research modules and a validation environment
 - Schedule information
 - N tested samples

we would have to do:
 - Integration into the system
 - layout

Advantage over MOSIS: 
 - free
 - state of the art process
 - results directly comparable with other research 
 
Questions:
 - Shall we make the selection process open (harness the scrutiny of the research community) or based on our vision of industrial relevance (may not be very popular), a mix of both ?
 - What would be the default number of samples given away ?
 - Current system is based on ARM Cortex M0:
	- Is it an issue to provide it in a netlist form in the validation environment ?
	- shall we switch to another CPU:
		- OpenRisc -> open source
		- MK3 -> would increase the pool of people able to program this CPU and its market acceptance

Misc:
 - access to each block would be protected by a password so that researchers can control who can use the block if they which to.
